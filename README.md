# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Problem Statement
In large-scale disasters, understanding the factors that influence survival is critical for improving emergency response and safety planning.
This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic disaster to identify demographic and socio-economic factors associated with survival outcomes.

## Objective
To explore the Titanic passenger dataset and uncover patterns related to survival based on gender, age, passenger class, fare, and family size.

## Dataset
The dataset contains passenger-level information including age, sex, ticket class, fare, family relationships, and survival status.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Questions Explored
- How did survival rates differ by gender?
- Did passenger class influence survival probability?
- How did age affect survival outcomes?
- Did traveling with family impact survival chances?
- Was fare level associated with survival?

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than male passengers.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to those in lower classes.
- Children showed better survival outcomes than adults.
- Passengers traveling with small to medium family sizes exhibited higher survival rates compared to those traveling with very large families.
- Higher fare levels were generally associated with improved survival chances.

## Implications
- Emergency evacuation protocols should prioritize vulnerable groups.
- Safety access should be more equitable across socio-economic classes.
- Group dynamics should be considered in disaster response planning.
